## Introduction

This HTML and CSS code is designed to create a visually appealing and realistic clock on a web page. It utilizes CSS animations and styles to mimic the appearance of a traditional analog clock.

## Usage

To use this code to create the clock on your webpage, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Include the `style.css` file in your HTML document by adding the following line in the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
   ```

3. Copy the HTML code provided in the `index.html` file and paste it into your own HTML file where you want the clock to appear.

4. Customize the clock's appearance by modifying the CSS in the `style.css` file as needed.

5. Save your HTML file and open it in a web browser to view the clock.

## HTML Structure

The HTML structure of the clock consists of the following elements:

- `<div class="clock">`: The main container for the clock.
  - `<div class="face">`: The clock's face.
  - `<div class="hour hand">`: The hour hand.
  - `<div class="minute hand">`: The minute hand.
  - `<div class="cover">`: A decorative cover for the center of the clock.
  - `<div class="second-bulb">`: A small bulb at the center representing the seconds.
  - `<div class="second hand">`: The second hand.
  - `<div class="number">12</div>`: Numerical markers for 12 and 3 positions.
  - `<div class="number">3</div>`: Numerical markers for 12 and 3 positions.

## CSS Styles

The CSS styles provided in the `style.css` file define the appearance and animations of the clock. Some key CSS features include:

- `@keyframes` and `@-webkit-keyframes` for defining animation sequences for the clock hands.
- CSS properties like `transform`, `box-shadow`, and `filter` to create realistic visual effects.
- Media queries for adjusting the font size and other styles based on the screen width.

Feel free to customize the CSS styles to match your desired clock design and integrate it into your web project.
